# GA SEI35 Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to my first coding project, involving the game of "Tic Tac Toe" ("Knots and Crosses" for some).

This is a brief overwiew of the technologies used, instructions using the application, any issues I ran into creating the project and things to look forward to in future updates.

If you want to just get straight into the application follow this link:

**OR**

If you want to take a look at what I doing to update the project you can headover to:

## Playing the application
1. Select the token you want to play with.
2. Select a tile on the board and then press "Confirm" to end your turn and pass play to the other player.


## For the future
- [ ] Addition of an AI that utilises the "Minimax Algorithm"
- [ ] Implement handles to allow the application to completely "load" before it
