# GA SEI35 Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to my first coding project, involving the game of "Tic Tac Toe" ("Knots and Crosses" for some).

This is a brief overwiew of the technologies used, instructions using the application, any issues I ran into creating the project and things to look forward to in future updates.

If you want to just get straight into the application follow this link:

## Playing the application
1. Select the token you want to play with.
2. Select a tile on the board and then press "Confirm" to end your turn and pass play to the other player. Some notes regarding your turn:
    - You can take back your move before you hit "Confirm" by clicking on the same tile you just placed a token in
    - You can't pass play until you have filled a tile with a token
3. A tally of your wins will be taken according to the token you won with.
4. You can reset the gameboard at any time by clicking "Restart" (**NOTE:** there is a four second load time for the game board to become "live" again)
5. The game board will automatically reset if a winner hasn't been found after the 9th turn of play has been confirmed. (Shares the same load time as the "Restart" function)
